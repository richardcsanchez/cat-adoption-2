#Cat Adoption
This Rails App allows a User to browse a collection of cats and 'adopt' them. If a user is an "Admin," they have the ability to add an Adoption Agency and Cats, as well as edit and delete these items.

(Note fro Flatiron Instructors: This project was originally started in a different repository and transferred to a new one at the suggestion of Luisa, the Rails Section Lead)

##Installation

To clone the project and get started, enter the following code into your terminal.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:richardcsanchez/cat-adoption-2.git
```
And then execute:
```
$ bundle install

$ rails s
```
##Usage
On the Homepage, you are given options to Login or Sign Up.

In order to sign up, you need to enter your Name, Email, & Password, as well as 'Money.' This money will be used to adopt cats! 

After logging in, you can browse the cats by breed or by state, as well as by adoption agency. Provided you have enough money, you will be able to adopt any cats and add them to your collection!

Admins are able to create new adoption agencies and add cats to new or existing agencies. 

If you own a cat, they will be only visible to you and removed from the index page.

To leave the app, the logout button appears on the bottom of the page after logging in.
